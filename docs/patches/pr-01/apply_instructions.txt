To apply PR-01 (tenant utils + conftest change):

1. From the repository root run:

   git fetch origin
   git checkout -b fix/tenant-utils

2. Copy the files from this folder into your repo (preserving paths), for example:

   mkdir -p backend/tests/utils
   cp docs/patches/pr-01/backend_tests_utils_tenants.py backend/tests/utils/tenants.py
   cp docs/patches/pr-01/conftest.py backend/tests/conftest.py

3. Stage and commit:

   git add backend/tests/utils/tenants.py backend/tests/conftest.py
   git commit -m "tests: consolidate tenant helper under tests.utils and prefer import path in conftest"

4. Push and open PR as usual:

   git push -u origin fix/tenant-utils

Note: The provided files in this folder are named with underscores to avoid nested folders in the patch archive; move them to the proper paths shown above.
