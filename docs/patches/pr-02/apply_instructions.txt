To apply PR-02 (concurrency smoke test):

1. From the repository root run:

   git checkout -b test/tenant-concurrency

2. Copy the files from this folder into your repo (preserving paths), for example:

   cp docs/patches/pr-02/backend_tests_test_tenant_concurrency.py backend/tests/test_tenant_concurrency.py

3. Stage and commit:

   git add backend/tests/test_tenant_concurrency.py
   git commit -m "tests: add concurrency smoke test for tenant helper"

4. Push and open PR as usual:

   git push -u origin test/tenant-concurrency
